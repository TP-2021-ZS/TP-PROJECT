# Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher

# Installation:
- best scenario is to use Anaconda.
- create virtual environment using Anaconda or manually using venv library.
- if using PyCharm(kernel/venv setup) with Anaconda:
  - File -> Settings -> Project -> Python Interpreter -> (gear) -> Add -> Conda Environment -> use existing and select your created conda env.
  - Add configuration(top panel) -> Add -> Python -> choose 'Python interpreter'(virtual environment you just created) -> choose 'Script path'(script that u want to run).
- if using PyCharm(kernel/venv setup) with venv:
  - File -> Settings -> Project -> Python Interpreter -> (gear) -> Add -> Virtual Environment -> use existing and select your created venv.
- In terminal run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in order to install libraries.

Regarding any questions about setup contact Andrej.

# Anaconda WARRNING:
- If you start using pip package manager, use only pip.
- If you start using conda package manager, use only conda.
- If you start using both, it can lead to lots of pain, anger and misery. May result in hard headache, because it can fck up your environment.
